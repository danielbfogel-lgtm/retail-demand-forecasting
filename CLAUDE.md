# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## 1. What this project is

A **Retail Demand Forecasting & Inventory Planning System** built on the UCI *Online Retail II*
dataset (Chen, 2019 — CC BY 4.0; Kaggle mirror `mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci`).

> A Streamlit application that analyses historical sales, uses **one global machine-learning model**
> to predict how many units each active product will sell next month, converts the forecast into a
> **Recommended Target Inventory** using safety stock derived from out-of-sample forecast errors, and
> lets users evaluate product forecasts, model performance and the trade-off between stockouts and
> excess inventory.

Two separate layers — never conflate them:

1. **Forecasting layer (ML)** — predicts *demand* (SKU × month → units sold).
2. **Inventory-policy layer (deterministic rule)** — converts the forecast into target inventory.
   The model never predicts inventory.

The specification of record is **`docs/PRD.md` (PRD v1.3)**. Every section reference below (`§10`,
`§20`, `§35A`, `Appendix A`) points there. **If this file and the PRD disagree, the PRD wins** —
and fix this file in the same PR.

## 2. Non-negotiable rules

These are the invariants the whole project is graded on. Violating one is a bug even if the tests
pass. Read this list before writing any code.

1. **No leakage.** No feature may use information from the target month `t` or later. Forecast
   origin is `t−1`; allowed information is everything with `month ≤ t−1`. Calendar attributes of
   `t` (`target_month_of_year`, `target_quarter`) are the only exception — they are known in
   advance. (§16, §17)
2. **`train_test_split(shuffle=True)` is forbidden.** The split is temporal (§21). A test enforces
   that `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` is never imported under `src/`.
3. **LLM agents never compute numbers.** No wMAPE, Bias, aggregation, MAD, safety stock, prediction
   or split is ever produced by a model. Agents call approved deterministic tools, interpret their
   output and write prose. Every LLM-written narrative passes the `numbers_in_tables` guard before
   it is accepted; on failure the deterministic version is restored. (§38)
4. **No number is hard-coded.** Thresholds, dates, `k`, `z`, gates, ABC cut-offs, seeds — all live in
   `config/*.yaml`. Indicative numbers from the PRD (row counts, wMAPE ≈ 55 %) are *expectations to
   log and compare against*, never literals in code and never asserted in tests. (§14 convention, §40)
5. **December 2011 is never scored.** It is a partial month (through 9 Dec). It may be shown as
   "partial actual" (hatched, labelled), and it is the target of the latest operational forecast —
   but it never enters a metric. Last full month is 2011-11. (§8, §16, §21) The recursive horizons
   of §32A obey the same boundary the other way round: from the first forecast month onward the
   panel's units are the model's forecast, so December's truncated actuals never enter a feature
   window either — `pipeline.multi_horizon.partial_month_unreachable` proves it by perturbation.
6. **Gross demand.** The target is units sold on positive sales lines. Cancellations (`C` invoices)
   and adjustments are **not** subtracted — inventory was needed to fulfil the original order.
   `returned_units` is EDA-only and is **never** a feature. Rows without `Customer ID` are **kept**.
   (§9, §13.2)
7. **wMAPE and Bias are always reported together.** Never one without the other. (§23)
8. **Robust σ only.** `Robust σ = 1.4826 × MAD` of **out-of-sample** residuals from origins strictly
   before the evaluation month. Never `np.std`, never in-sample residuals. (§22, §26)
9. **ABC from the training window only** for anything touching modelling, evaluation or σ fallback.
   Full-period ABC exists for descriptive EDA (E6) and must be labelled as such. (§18.2, §23, §27)
10. **The output is "Recommended Target Inventory", never "Order Quantity".** The dataset has no
    on-hand / on-order data, so an order quantity cannot be computed. (§7)
11. **`z = 1.645` does not guarantee a 95 % fill rate.** The achieved fill rate is measured
    empirically in the back-test. Any UI or document text implying otherwise is a defect. (§25)
12. **Post-hoc bias correction is out of scope.** It proved unstable and is explicitly excluded from
    the MVP. (§20)
13. **Failed runs never overwrite good results.** Everything is written to a staging directory and
    promoted only on success. A failed run writes `validation_report.json`, sets
    `run_log.json → status: failed`, exits non-zero and leaves the previous forecasts untouched. (§39)
14. **Exact artifact names.** Eight artifacts are required by the course brief and must exist with
    exactly these names (§41):
    `clean_data.csv`, `features.csv`, `model.joblib`, `eda_report.html`, `insights.md`,
    `dataset_contract.json`, `evaluation_report.md`, `model_card.md`.
15. **Raw data is never committed.** `data/raw/*` is git-ignored; a script downloads it and verifies
    a SHA-256 hash. `clean_data.csv` and `features.csv` *are* committed. (§42)
16. **Determinism.** Single global seed (`model_config.yaml → seed`, 42). Two runs on the same data
    must produce byte-identical `clean_data.csv`, `features.csv` and metrics. (§40)

```

Import style is src-layout with an editable install: `from pipeline.config import ...`,
`from flow.main import ...`, `from app.data_access import ...`. Never rename these paths — later
issues reference them literally.

## 4. Environment — read this before running anything

**Python 3.11 only.** `pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.12"` (PRD §43) and CI
runs 3.11. On the primary dev machine (Daniel, Windows) the *global* interpreter is **3.14**, and
3.12 is also installed — neither may be used. Building the venv with the wrong one makes
`pip install -e .` fail with:

```
ERROR: Package 'retail-demand-forecasting' requires a different Python: 3.12.6 not in '<3.12,>=3.11'
```

That error means the venv was built with the wrong interpreter. **Never** widen `requires-python` to
make an install succeed — the pin is a PRD requirement and must match CI.

**Never rely on venv activation persisting.** Each shell invocation is independent, so an activated
environment does not carry across commands. Call the interpreter by path instead:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q          # Windows
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q                  # Linux / CI
```

Before any long task, confirm which interpreter is live:
`.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"` → must start with `3.11`.

**Installs go through `uv`.** It is far faster than pip and resolves the same pinned set.
`requirements.txt` (`==` pins) remains the single source of truth: do **not** add `[tool.uv]` to
`pyproject.toml`, do not create or commit `uv.lock`, and do not migrate to uv-native dependency
management — CI installs with plain pip and the two must stay in agreement.

**OneDrive.** The repo lives inside a synced OneDrive folder. OneDrive can lock files mid-operation
and cause spurious `Permission denied` / `Access is denied` errors during `uv pip install`,
`Remove-Item .venv`, or artifact writes. Retry once; if it repeats, ask the user to pause OneDrive
syncing rather than engineering around it in code.

## 5. Commands

### Setup — Windows / PowerShell (primary dev environment)

PowerShell 5.1 does not accept `&&` as a statement separator — run these one line at a time.

```powershell
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e            # one-time: install uv

Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
uv venv --python 3.11                          # uv fetches 3.11 itself if absent
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python --version                               # must print 3.11.x
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install -e .
```

If `Activate.ps1` is blocked by execution policy:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, then retry.

### Setup — Linux / macOS / CI

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .
```

### Project commands

Prefix each with the venv interpreter (`.venv\Scripts\python.exe` on Windows, `.venv/bin/python`
elsewhere) unless the environment is verified active.

```bash
# data
python -m pipeline.download --record-hash     # download + hash
python -m pipeline.download --make-sample     # tests/fixtures/raw_sample.csv for CI

# pipeline
python -m pipeline --no-llm                   # full deterministic run (CI mode)
python -m pipeline --no-llm --sample --skip-tuning   # fast run on the fixture
python -m pipeline                            # LLM mode (crews run; needs an API key)

# app
python -m streamlit run src/app/Home.py

# quality
python -m pytest -q
python -m pytest -q -m "not slow"
python -m ruff check src tests
python scripts/mvp_acceptance_check.py        # §49 checklist -> acceptance_report.md

# deliverables (§53) — generated from the artifacts, never hand-edited
python scripts/build_presentation.py          # -> docs/presentation.pptx + presentation_notes.md
python scripts/capture_screens.py             # -> docs/img/screens/*.png (needs Chrome + selenium)
```

Written as `python -m <tool>` deliberately: invoking `pytest` / `ruff` / `streamlit` as bare
executables can pick up a globally installed copy running under the wrong Python. `python -m` always
uses the interpreter you named.

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` validation failure (graceful stop), `1` unexpected exception.

## 6. Architecture

### CrewAI Flow (§37) — ten steps

```
Raw data → 1 Dataset intake → 2 Data Analyst Crew work → 3 Contract validation
→ 4 Data Scientist Crew work → 5 Feature validation → 6 Temporal training & back-testing
→ 7 Model evaluation & champion selection → 8 Inventory policy calibration
→ 9 Artifact validation → 10 Publish to Streamlit
```

- State is a Pydantic `FlowState` (run id, timestamp, data hash, artifact paths, validation flags,
  metrics, champion, errors).
- A `@router` after steps 1, 3, 5 and 9 returns `continue` or `fail`.
- **The Flow always executes the deterministic tools itself.** In LLM mode the crews are kicked off
  *around* those steps to review results and write narrative — so `--no-llm` and LLM runs produce
  numerically identical artifacts. Crews never run after a failure.

### Crews (≥ 3 agents each — course requirement)

| Crew | Agents |
|---|---|
| Data Analyst (§35) | Data Quality Analyst · Data Preparation Analyst · Business & EDA Analyst |
| Data Scientist (§36) | Feature Engineering Specialist · Forecasting Model Scientist · Model Evaluation & Inventory Scientist |

### Canonical model ids — use these strings everywhere

`B1_last_month` · `B2_ma3` (**main baseline**) · `B3_seasonal_naive` (reference only) ·
`M1_linear` · `M2_gbm_poisson` (**primary ML**) · `M3_gbm_squared` · `M4_gbm_absolute` (challenger)

### Champion gates (§20) — executed by code, never by hand

1. **Bias gate** — `|Bias| ≤ 0.10` on the hold-out; months with `|Bias| > 0.25` are reported but do
   not fail the gate.
2. **Accuracy** — lowest wMAPE among gate-1 passers.
3. **Inventory tie-break** — within 1 wMAPE point, prefer less excess at similar fill rate.
4. **Meaningful improvement** — an ML model "improves on the baseline" only if it beats the best
   gate-passing baseline by **≥ 2 wMAPE points**.

Gates apply to **every** candidate including baselines. A baseline winning, or
"simple methods are competitive", is a **legitimate, expected outcome** — report it plainly. Never
tune the pipeline to make ML look better. There is no `--force-champion` flag and there must never be.

### Key formulas — copy verbatim

```text
wMAPE           = Σ|Actual − Forecast| / Σ Actual
Bias            = Σ(Forecast − Actual) / Σ Actual
residual e      = Actual − Forecast
Robust σ        = 1.4826 × median(|e − median(e)|)          # ≥ 6 out-of-sample residuals per product
Safety Stock    = z × σ                                      # z = 1.645 default
Target Inventory= ceil( max(0, Forecast + z × σ) )           # 820, σ 70, z 1.645 → 936
Fill Rate       = Σ Fulfilled / Σ Actual
```

σ fallback hierarchy: **product** (≥ 6 residuals) → **ABC group** (training-window ABC) →
**global**. The level used is stored per product as `sigma_source` and shown in the app.

Active product (§14): at least one positive sale in the `k = 6` months before the target month.

Multi-horizon (§32A): horizons beyond the operational month are **recursive** — each month's
forecast is fed back into the panel as that month's units, and the same champion predicts the next.
Every horizon carries its own robust σ, measured from a back-test at that horizon; never price a
horizon with the one-step-ahead σ. A quarter's target inventory is the **sum of its monthly
targets** (lead time is one month, so the buffer is held monthly) — there is no quarterly model and
no quarterly σ.

Temporal split (§21): train targets **2010-03 … 2011-05**; internal validation folds
**2011-01 … 2011-05**; hold-out **2011-06 … 2011-11**; back-test origins **2010-05 … 2011-10**.

## 7. Configuration

Never write a constant into code — read it from config.

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `cleaning_config.yaml` | cancellation/adjustment prefixes, price & quantity rules, duplicate policy, warning thresholds, month boundaries |
| `model_config.yaml` | seed, `k`, feature list, split & back-test dates, model ids and hyper-parameters, tuning grid, champion gates |
| `inventory_policy.yaml` | lead time, `z` and `z_options`, MAD scale, min residuals for σ, ABC thresholds |
| `non_inventory_stockcodes.csv` | excluded codes with `reason` and `status` |
| `data_sources.yaml` | dataset URLs, expected SHA-256, citation |

`config_snapshot()` is recorded in every `run_log.json`.

## 8. Working on an issue

Work is tracked in **Linear**, project `AI_DEV_final_poject` (team `AI_DEV_final_project`), issues
`AI-5` … `AI-44`, titled `US-00` … `US-39` in execution order with `blocked by` relations and
category labels (`data-pipeline`, `eda`, `modeling`, `evaluation`, `inventory-policy`, `crewai`,
`orchestration`, `streamlit-ui`, `testing`, `ci-cd`, `docs`, `deliverable`) plus milestone labels
`M1`–`M6`.

Each issue body is the source of truth for that unit of work and contains: the user story, an
**AI Prompt** (exact files, paths, formulas, PRD sections), **Technical notes**, **Notes**,
a **Report for review** instruction, **Acceptance criteria**, and **Claude Code execution settings**
(model / reasoning effort / plan mode). Follow the issue's own execution settings.

**Before writing any code — the drift check (mandatory).**

Every issue in this project was written from the PRD *before* the code existed, so its prompt
describes an API that was guessed. Cross-cutting modules are now real, and the issue text drifts
from them. Therefore the first step of every issue, before a single line is written:

1. Read `docs/interfaces.md` — the generated, authoritative surface of `pipeline.paths`,
   `pipeline.config`, `pipeline.run_context` and `pipeline.validation`, plus the usage rules every
   step must obey (`ctx.out`, `ctx.step`, `log_rows`, `run_id`, the staging bypass list).
2. Read the current source of every module this issue imports. Not the issue's description of it.
3. Compare the issue's prompt and acceptance criteria against both, and report every mismatch —
   wrong signature, non-existent config key, path written without `ctx.out()`, criterion that cannot
   pass — as a comment on the issue **before** implementing.
4. Where an issue carries a `## 8. Interface corrections` section, that section outranks the prompt
   above it.

If the issue you are implementing is itself a foundational module (one that later issues import),
its definition of done additionally includes: add its section to `docs/interfaces.md`, and re-run
the drift check across every issue that depends on it.

**Definition of done for any issue:**

1. Every acceptance-criteria checkbox in the issue verifiably passes — run them in the 3.11 venv (§4),
   do not assume. Paste the actual command output into the Linear issue as evidence.
2. The named tests exist and pass; `python -m ruff check src tests` is clean.
3. No PRD invariant from §2 above is broken (grep for the forbidden patterns listed in the issue).
4. The **Report for review** is written: a step-by-step, plain-language explanation for a
   non-programmer, defining every technical term on first use, plus a one-line description of every
   file created or changed. This is a deliverable, not a formality.
5. A PR is opened against protected `main` with the template filled in (What / Why / How tested) and
   the CI checks green.

Branch naming: `feature/US-NN-short-name`. Every change merges through a PR with ≥ 1 reviewer.
Each milestone ends with a merged PR and a green CI run (§54).

**Ownership** — Daniel: platform/config/logging (US-00–02), Streamlit (US-27–30), CI, docs,
determinism, presentation, demo. מתן הלל: raw data → cleaning → panel → data quality → EDA →
contract → Data Analyst Crew (US-03–12), then the Flow (US-31–33). Dor Hll: features → leakage →
metrics → models → back-test → evaluation → σ → inventory → champion → reports → Data Scientist Crew
(US-13–26). Check the Linear assignee before starting something outside your slice.

## 9. Tests (§55)

| File | Proves |
|---|---|
| `test_cleaning.py` | waterfall counts, exclusion list, duplicate policy |
| `test_panel.py` | zero-fill, no rows before first sale, partial flag |
| `test_contract.py` | validation passes, and fails on corrupted samples |
| `test_features.py` | lag correctness, active rule, NaN policy |
| `test_leakage.py` | permutation of future months leaves features unchanged |
| `test_metrics.py` | wMAPE / Bias on known arrays |
| `test_inventory.py` | σ, safety stock, target, simulation |
| `test_flow.py` | graceful failure path produces `validation_report.json` |
| `test_determinism.py` | two runs identical |

Add tests in the file the PRD names — do not invent a parallel structure.

## 10. Style and conventions

- Python 3.11, pandas / numpy / scikit-learn / CrewAI / Streamlit / Matplotlib+Seaborn, Joblib,
  Pydantic v2, pytest. Versions pinned in `requirements.txt`.
- Charts: **Matplotlib / Seaborn only** (course requirement). One consistent colour-blind-safe
  palette; ABC classes always the same three colours; every figure has a title, axis labels *with
  units*, a source footnote, and one message. Log scale must be stated in the axis label. Figures
  are ≥ 150 dpi PNGs under `artifacts/reports/figures/` with stable `E<nn>_<name>.png` names.
- `eda_report.html` is a **single self-contained file** — PNGs embedded as base64, no external
  or CDN references, must render offline.
- Numbers in `insights.md` (8–12 insights) must all exist in a computed table under
  `eda_tables/`. The `numbers_in_tables` guard enforces this.
- Months are always `YYYY-MM` strings; timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC.
- Deterministic file writes: fixed sort order, fixed `float_format`, no index column.
- Never log or commit an API key. `--no-llm` mode must import no LLM class at all.

## 11. Common pitfalls

- Computing a rolling window without excluding month `t` — the single most likely way to break the
  project. Recompute a lag by hand from `clean_data.csv` when in doubt.
- Using full-period ABC where training-window ABC is required.
- Using `np.std` instead of the MAD-based robust σ; a few 80,000-unit wholesale lines will destroy it.
- Scoring December 2011, or letting it into a feature window.
- Subtracting returns from the target.
- Letting an agent state a number that is not in a table.
- Writing an artifact directly instead of through the staging path, so a failed run corrupts good output.
- Silently dropping rows so two models are compared on different row sets — all policies and
  candidates are scored on identical rows.

## 12. Glossary

**Forecast origin** — last month whose data may be used. **Active product** — ≥ 1 sale in the
previous `k` months. **wMAPE** — Σ|error| / Σ actual. **Bias** — Σ(forecast − actual) / Σ actual.
**Robust σ** — 1.4826 × MAD of out-of-sample residuals. **Fill rate** — fulfilled / actual demand.
**Champion** — the model selected by the §20 gates. **Left-censoring** — products already selling in
Dec 2009 may be older, so `product_age_months` is a lower bound.
