"""Feature engineering — ``features.csv`` (PRD §14, §16, §17, §21, §47).

One row per ``(stock_code, target_month)`` for every product that is **active** at that target
month (§14: at least one positive sale in the ``k`` months before it), carrying the fifteen §17
features. The grain changes here: the panel of US-05 is indexed by the month a sale *happened*,
this table is indexed by the month being *predicted*.

**The no-leakage boundary (§16) is structural, not a filter.** The forecast origin is ``t−1``, and
every feature is built from a series that has already been shifted one month back inside each
product, so month ``t`` is not reachable by any window — it is not computed and then removed. The
only values taken from ``t`` itself are ``target_month_of_year`` and ``target_quarter``: calendar
attributes, known in advance, the single exception §17 allows.

Window conventions (§17), all falling out of one construction — reindex every product onto the full
month grid of the observed dataset, fill absent months with zero units, then ``shift(1)`` and roll
with ``min_periods=1``:

* **Months before a product's first sale are observed zeros.** The dataset saw those months; the
  product simply had not launched. They count as zero-demand months in every rolling statistic, so
  a product launched in 2010-06 has ``rolling_mean_6`` divided by six at target 2010-09.
* **Months before the dataset begins are unobserved.** They never existed and are excluded, so
  windows are *truncated* rather than padded: at the first target month (2010-03) only three months
  are available and ``rolling_mean_6`` is divided by three. In the code this is the ``NaN`` that
  ``shift(1)`` leaves in each product's first grid row — rolling aggregations skip it.
* **``product_age_months`` is a lower bound** for products already selling in the first observed
  month (left-censoring, §47): they may be far older than the data can show.

Two counting conventions, chosen to agree with each other: ``months_since_last_sale`` is 1 when the
last sale was in ``t−1`` (as §17 pins), and ``product_age_months`` is likewise 1 when the first
sale was in ``t−1`` — both count *months of history through the origin*, never a raw difference
that would read 0 against the other's 1. ``rolling_std_3`` is the population standard deviation
(``ddof=0``), which also makes a single-observation window ``0.0`` instead of ``NaN``.

``stock_code`` is an identifier and never a feature (§17); ``returned_units``, ``customer_count``
and country are never used (§9, §13.2). The optional v2 features (``lag_12``, ``trend_3``, ABC as a
feature) are deliberately absent (§17, §18).

``build_features`` is **pure** — it returns a frame and touches no disk; :func:`write_features`
performs the write through ``ctx.out()`` (``docs/interfaces.md`` §6 rules 1 and 5).
